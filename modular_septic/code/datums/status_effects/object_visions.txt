They say I am excitable!
Yesterday, over my house
He met a hideous creature without a face
ORDINATORS, KILL THIS BASTARD!
Let's kill!
We always watch you and everything you do to these people.
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer
Everything hurts.
Do you really know what to do?
All will be fine.
And they sit, and they sit.
You taught us how to feel. It was the right decision.
Everything is right at home.
RANDY SANDY!
Hell's just at my doorstep.
The shit won't clean itself. Murder!
Think outside of the box.
13 37...
Rip his fucking cock off!
You don't deserve to be loved.
Why are we still here?
Just to suffer?
Hangars are just parking lots. Think about it.
CRIMINAL. CRIMINAL. CRIMINAL.
Murderer.
You're vile.
You can do it.
Wake up.
Who are you?
Who am i?
Burn them! Kill them!
Cleanse the unworthy!
Kill them all. Who will stop you?
A little... heart to heart.
They are not made of flesh... They are not made of bone...
Cogs in a machine.
Stab! Stab! Stab!
Rape me. Rape me, my friend.
The flesh that hates.
I have no mouth, and yet i must scream.
Take notes.
A heart of gold.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning
